# CodeIgniter-RestServer

A fully RESTful server implementation for CodeIgniter using one library, one
config file and one controller.

## Requirements

1. PHP 5.1+
2. CodeIgniter 1.7.x - 2.0-dev

## Usage

Coming soon. Take a look at application/controllers/example_api.php for
hints until the default controller demo is built and ready.

I haven't got around to writing any documentation specifically for this project
but you can read my NetTuts article covers it's usage along with the REST Client lib.
