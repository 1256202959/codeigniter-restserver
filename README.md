# CodeIgniter-RestServer

A fully RESTful server implementation for CodeIgniter using one library, one
config file and one controller.

## Sponsored by: Coding Futures

## Requirements

1. PHP 5.1+
2. CodeIgniter 2.0-dev (for 1.7.x support download v2.2 from Downloads tab)

## Usage

Coming soon. Take a look at application/controllers/api/example.php for
hints until the default controller demo is built and ready.

I haven't got around to writing any documentation specifically for this project
but you can read my NetTuts article which covers it's usage along with the REST Client lib.

so I can keep working on this and other CodeIgniter projects for you all.
